  <h3>Fun Fact 1</h3>
  <div>
	  <h2>Florida</h2>
    <p>
		
   The remains of an 8,000-year-old human civilization were found buried in a peat bog here. The bodies were so well preserved that human brain tissue was found in a woman’s skull with her DNA still intact. These are the cheapest months of the year to visit all 50 states.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Fun Fact 2</h3>
  <div>
	  <h2>Iowa</h2>
    <p>
    The world’s largest painted ball resides in Alexandria: The 4,000-pound baseball with a 14-foot circumference is the creation of Michael Carmichael, who began the project more than 50 years ago after dropping a ball in paint; he now adds another coat or two every year.

  <h3>Fun Fact 3</h3>
  <div>
	  <h2>Oregon</h2>
    <p>
  “Many people are not capable of knowing how to pump gas and the hazards of not doing it correctly. Besides I don't want to go to work smelling of gas when I get it on my hands or clothes. I agree Very bad idea.”
	  </p>
	  <p>
“I don't even know HOW to pump gas and I am 62, native Oregonian.....I say NO THANKS! I don't want to smell like gasoline!”
	  </p>
	  <p>
“I've lived in this state all my life and I REFUSE to pump my own gas. I had to do it once in California while visiting my brother and almost died doing it. This a service only qualified people should perform. I will literally park at the pump and wait until someone pumps my gas. I can't even”
    </p>
   
  </div>
  <h3>Fun Fact 4</h3>
  <div>
	  <h2>Kansas</h2>
    <p>
    It’s the state that was proved to be—quite literally—flatter than a pancake. Scientists tested the flatness of the state against the topography of a pancake. On a zero- to-one scale of perfect flatness, Kansas was flatter, with a score of 0.9997. The pancake scored only 0.957. But it’s worth noting that Kansas isn’t the flattest U.S. state. That title goes to…Florida.
