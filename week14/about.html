  <h3>Our Story</h3>
  <div>
	  
    <p>
		In 2004, Dr. Judith Broder took a walk on the beach. She came across Arlington West, the “temporary cemetery” that was installed near the Santa Monica pier in order to bring public attention to the growing death rate of the Iraq War. Soon after, she attended a production of The Sandstorm, a play about marines coming home from the conflict in Iraq, and decided that as a psychiatrist, she needed to do more to help a new generation assimilate back from war. The Soldiers Project was born.

    </p>
	  <p>
		  With help from colleagues and friends, The Soldiers Project launched as a sponsored project of the Los Angeles Institute and Society for Psychoanalytic Studies Trauma Center. For many years, the organization relied solely on the generosity of volunteers and pro bono mental health professionals. In September 2010, The Soldiers Project was incorporated as 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and began to hire its first professional staff.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	 	 Since then, The Soldiers Project has provided free and confidential treatment to thousands of military service members and their families, and provided trainings in best clinical practices to thousands of clinicians via in-person conferences, symposia and online webinars.

  <h3>Programs and Results</h3>
  <div>
	
    <p>
    TSP serves post-9/11 veterans, service members, and their family members and loved ones who need mental healthcare yet cannot access it. TSP treats individuals regardless of discharge status. Historically, individuals who have been less than honorably discharged are unable to receive veterans benefits and are at higher risk for suicide. While the VA issued a directive in July 2017 to provide up to 90 days of mental health services to those with an Other Than Honorable Discharge, at this time there are few resources to implement the policy change. As a result, 500,000 more veterans are attempting to receive care from the VA, overwhelming a network already experiencing months-long delays for mental health services.

  <h3>Our Clinical Philosophy
</h3>
  <div>
	  <p>We believe that the psychological connection to the therapist is of primary importance in enhancing the healing process. We favor an individualized approach to care, and let our volunteers do their work independently. Our therapists come from a wide variety of clinical backgrounds, but all are fully licensed and insured by the state in which they practice.
		</p>
	  <h3>
Client Confidentiality
</h3>
    <p>
 Our services are completely confidential. We understand that choosing to see a mental health provider is a decision that many individuals would like to keep private. We respect your right to privacy and never share details about who contacts us for help.
